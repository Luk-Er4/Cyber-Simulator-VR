# Immersive Cybersecurity Learning Application in VR #

Player will ***deep dive into computer system***, work as an agent to migitate effects from cyberthreats, and make the system back to normal. 
This repository offers the visualization of Windows Files Systems, and the immersive experience in handling random cyberthreats generated by LLM (Google Gemini).

## Features ##
- Immersive 3D visualization of Windows File Systems
- Random cyberthreat generation powered by Google Gemini LLM
- Two play modes: Practice Mode (safe) and Actual Mode (threat simulation)
- Interactive cybersecurity tools (File Scanner, Code Interpreter, CMD Panel, Notepad)
- Sandbox environment for safe experimentation with file system commands

## Project Setup A (Cloning Repo / Entering VR Dev Mode) ##

The steps involve with cloning repo and entering VR dev mode in the Meta Link system.

1. Download ***Unity Hub*** and ***Unity Editor 6*** on your PC &nbsp;(Environment for Unity project development)
2. Download ***Meta Quest Link*** on your PC &nbsp;(Software to connect your Oculus device to your PC)
3. Put your Oculus Quest device to developer mode &nbsp;(Allows to test the project in Unity Editor)
4. Download ***GitHub Desktop*** on your PC &nbsp;(Software to download this project)
5. Clone the repo, and create a subbranch for testing the project. 
6. Find “Unity” Folder in the repo, and add it to Unity Hub.
7. Connect your Oculus device to your PC, and test the project.

For the detailed set-up instructions, check the guide (WILL ADD DETAILED PDF GUIDE).

## Project Setup B (Getting Gemini API Key) ##

The project requires an API key for generating random cyberthreat scenarios. Here are the instructions to get your own.

1. Google "Google AI Studio", click "Get API Key", click "Create API Key", and copy your API key.
2. Click "Set up billing" to proceed with a free trial for 90 days with 300$ credits. (No cost will be spent!)
3. Paste your API key into the script (located at Assets/Scripts/CaseGenerator/CallAndMake.cs) at line 244.

Currently, "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" model is used to generate random cyberthreat scenarios since it can handle up to 1M tokens. 
You can switch to any Gemini model at line 261, but it should handle near to 1M tokens.

## How to Play ##

### [In the Practice Mode] - No malicious files are generated ###

1. Players will explore the computer file systems by entering the portal to switch directories, and utilizing interactive panels. 
2. File Scanners is used to detect malicious files, copy the file name, and copy the current directory(location).
3. File Readers is used to show the codes or texts in the file.
4. Code Interpreter is used to figure out what the file is doing (uses Gemini LLM). Contents copied from File Readers can be pasted into it.
5. Notepad is used for copying and pasting important information.
6. CMD Panel shows you the current directory and allows you to delete files.
   <br>6.1. "del" commands help you to delete selected files you are targeting.
   <br>6.2. "rmdir" commands help you to delete selected empty directories (if /s is inactivated), or the directories with the files (if /s is activated) 

### [In the Actual Mode] - Virtual malicious files are generated ###

1. Players will wait until the virtual cyber scenario is created.
2. Use all the resources introduced in **[In the Practice Mode]**, find and delete all the generated malicious files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deleting innocent files & overtime will deduct performance points. If the playtime takes too long, it results in game over.

## Educational Impacts ##

A lot of cybersecurity education programs use virtual machines to simulate actual cyberthreat cases. 
However, they are not easily accessible for most of people, and although they take the program, some of them have a hard time to follow all their materials and content.
The project aims to provide the middle-level step and high accessibility for people to move forward in learning advanced cybersecurity features.
With this introductory cybersecurity learning application, players can experience simpler random cyberattack cases in a short time, with less cost, and with high accessibility.
Also, it offers a sandbox to modify File Systems by using CMD commands to delete files, which causes a huge problem when we try it on our PC. 

## Future Plans (as of Aug 2025) ##

This project is still in development stages, so a lot of features need to be updated.
Currently, players cannot get clues to find malicious files, so working on **Task Manager**, **Event Viewer**, and **Windows Registry Keys** is on the plan.
Along with that, Gemini pipelines (or agents) for generating random cyberthreat cases will be updated as well. Linux File Systems will be included in the future (Android as well, if possible) .
